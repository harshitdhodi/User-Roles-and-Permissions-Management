To build a robust user management system where different roles have specific permissions and admins can trace activities, here’s a structured approach for your requirements:

### 1. **User Roles and Permissions Structure:**
   Define the roles in your system and their respective permissions. Below is an example of roles with permissions:

   #### **Roles:**
   - **Super Admin**: Can manage all settings and users, including modifying roles, permissions, and settings.
   - **Admin**: Can manage users, view logs, and configure services (limited compared to Super Admin).
   - **Team Member**: Can access specific features, such as managing or viewing their assigned tasks or services.
   - **Accountant**: Can manage financial data, invoices, and payments.
   - **Master**: A special role for specific privileged access, perhaps to oversee critical business operations or resources.

   #### **Permissions:**
   For each role, define the permissions they have. Permissions can be grouped like this:

   - **Read**: View data.
   - **Write**: Add/modify data.
   - **Delete**: Remove data.
   - **Assign**: Allocate tasks or services to users.
   - **Approve**: Grant approvals (e.g., for financial transactions, queries).
   - **Manage**: Manage settings, users, etc.
   - **Trace**: Track activities and logs.

### 2. **User Activity Logs:**
   Implement a system to log user actions for auditing purposes. Each action (e.g., logging in, adding, editing, deleting data) should create an entry in a log table with the following details:
   - **User ID**: Who performed the action.
   - **Action Type**: What action was taken (e.g., "Created a new client", "Edited tour package").
   - **Timestamp**: When the action occurred.
   - **Details**: Any relevant additional information, such as changes made to data.
   
   Example structure for a `logs` table:
   ```json
   {
      "user_id": "1",
      "action_type": "Create",
      "module": "Client",
      "details": "Created a new client - John Doe",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-14T12:30:00"
   }
   ```

### 3. **Dashboard & User Management Interface:**
   Create a central dashboard where admins can:
   - View and manage users by role.
   - Assign and modify permissions.
   - Track activities for each user, including login history and changes made.
   - Filter logs by user, date, or activity type.

### 4. **Activity Trace and Admin View:**
   For **admins** to trace all activities, implement features such as:
   - **Activity Feed**: Show a timeline of recent activities, like new client creation or edits to bookings.
   - **Filter by User**: Admins can filter logs by user to see their specific actions.
   - **Export Logs**: Admins can export logs for audits or reporting.
   - **Real-time Monitoring**: If needed, provide real-time updates of admin activities in the system (useful for critical changes).

### 5. **Managing Permissions Dynamically:**
   - **Granular Permissions**: Allow admins to change or assign specific permissions dynamically for each user. E.g., "Can view client information" or "Can modify visa services."
   - **UI for Managing Roles**: Provide a user interface for assigning/removing roles and permissions from users (preferably with checkboxes for each action).
   - **Permission Hierarchy**: Ensure that certain roles (like Super Admin) have more permissions than others. You can structure this using role inheritance (e.g., Admin inherits basic permissions from Super Admin but can be restricted).

### 6. **System Architecture Recommendations:**
   - **Database Schema for Users & Roles**:
     - `users`: Stores user details.
     - `roles`: Defines roles like Super Admin, Admin, etc.
     - `permissions`: Specific permissions for each role.
     - `user_permissions`: Mapping of users to their roles and permissions.
     - `activity_logs`: Stores all actions performed by users.
     
     Example of `user_roles` and `role_permissions` tables:
     ```json
     user_roles: {
        user_id: 1,
        role_id: 2
     }
     
     role_permissions: {
        role_id: 2,
        permission_id: 4
     }
     ```

### 7. **Technologies to Use:**
   - **Backend**: Use a framework like **Node.js** with **Express** for API handling and user management.
   - **Database**: Implement **MongoDB** for flexible data storage and role-based queries, or use **PostgreSQL** for relational data.
   - **Frontend**: Implement React with a role-based UI to display different functionalities for each role.
   - **Authentication**: Use **JWT** tokens or **OAuth** for secure user authentication and role-based access control (RBAC).
   
   Example flow:
   - User logs in → JWT token is generated → Access is granted based on roles/permissions → Admin can view logs and manage users.

### 8. **Security Considerations:**
   - **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use this to ensure that users can only perform actions allowed by their role.
   - **Secure Data**: Use **bcrypt** for password hashing and **SSL** for encrypting communications.
   - **Audit Trails**: Make sure activity logs are immutable and cannot be tampered with.

### 9. **UI/UX for Admin:**
   - **Role Management Panel**: Admins can easily manage user roles and permissions via a dedicated page with checkboxes or dropdowns for each permission.
   - **Activity Logs**: Use tables or timelines for easy browsing of logs, with filters for specific actions or users.
